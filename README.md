## Second reunion: 4.03
Preparation: 
List of topics we could treat: 
- Tristan
  - Creative analysis: 
    - Pre-match analysis: formations, number of goals scored in competition so far, player that run most, preferentials playing schemes, way of playing (counter attack, possession ...), when they use to score goals (first 20mins, first half, ...).   
    - Analysing why the game has had so many goals. Was it predictibible? 
    - Importance of coaching: 2 goals of Croatia were scored by substitutes. 
    - Focus on the palyer of the match: Sergio Busquets (official). But we can also analyse "our" man of the match (Torres or Pedri, no no I'm not a barca fan haha).  
  - Traditional Analysis: 
    - General overview (like the thing that is already done in every applications to see number of shots, yellow cards...) 
    - Make duels: Modric vs Busquets
    - Passes: Networks of pass, passing sequences (ABA, ABAC...), Directions of passing
    - Shots: maps of all shots, expected goals
  - Tools: The gitlab contains a lot of tutorials to create graphs (passing networks, xG): https://gitlab.ethz.ch/socceranalytics/uefa-euro-2020/-/wikis/Data-and-Tools
- Mart√≠
  - Comparison between statistics of the each team in the whole competition and this particular match.
  - Discuss the different amount of completed passes of each team and analyse if it had a direct impact on possession, shots and goals.
  - A creative thing would be to come up with a score for each player to pick the best player of the match objectively. I don't know if we can use other games' statistics for this.
  - I would also like to see the real played time in this game, and if the % of played time respect the real time decreases as the game progresses (tiredness, a team losing time, etc.)
